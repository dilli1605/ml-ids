# Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (ML-IDS)

This project uses the NSL-KDD dataset to build a machine learning-based IDS that detects various types of network intrusions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Dataset files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data processing and modeling
- `models/`: Trained ML models
- `app/`: Web interface (Flask/Streamlit)
- `utils/`: Helper scripts

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter

## Dataset

NSL-KDD - Download from: https://github.com/defcom17/NSL_KDD

## Goals

- Train ML models to detect attacks
- Evaluate model performance
- Deploy a real-time classifier (optional)
